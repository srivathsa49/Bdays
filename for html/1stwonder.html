			<h1> Great wall of China </h1>
			<p> <strong> The Great Wall of China (Chinese: 萬里長城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) </strong> is the collective name of a series of fortification systems generally built across
				the historical northern borders of China to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic groups of the steppe
				and their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states;[2] selective stretches were later joined
				together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[3] Later on, many successive dynasties have built and 
			maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). </p>
			<p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included <strong> border controls</strong>, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk
				Road,regulation or <strong> encouragement of trade</strong> and the <strong> control of immigration and emigration </strong>.[4] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were
				enhanced by the construction of <strong> watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities </strong> through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that
			the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. </p>
