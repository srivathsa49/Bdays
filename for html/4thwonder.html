<h1> THE Machu picchu </h1>
<p> <b> Machu Picchu </b> is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.It is located in the Cusco Region,
 Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District,[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the    
 Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. </p>
<p> <b> Machu Picchu </b> is believed (by Richard L. Burger) to be built starting 1450–1460. Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui
 (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).[18][19]:xxxvi There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself,   
 most likely after a successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a <b>"royal" estate </b>, surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession.
 Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[17][page needed] It is possible that most of its
 inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. </p>
