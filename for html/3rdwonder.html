<h1> CHRIST THE REDEEMER </h1>
<p>  <strong> Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedenˈtoʁ], local pronunciation: [ˈkɾiɕtŭ̻ xe̞denˈtoɦ]) </strong> is an Art Deco statue of
 <strong> Jesus Christ </strong> in <strong>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong>, created by French sculptor <strong> Paul Landowski </strong> and built by <strong> Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa </strong>, in collaboration with French engineer
 Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft)  
 pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. </p>
<p> The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking
 the city of Rio de Janeiro. <strong>A symbol of Christianity </strong> across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the <strong>New 7 Wonders</strong>
 of the World.[3] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. </p>
